Basic Linear Algebra Reference implementation.

BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) is a set of efficient
routines for most of the basic vector and matrix operations.
They are widely used as the basis for other high quality linear
algebra software, for example lapack and linpack.  This
implementation is the Fortran 77 reference implementation found
at netlib.

BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) is a set of efficient
routines for most of the basic vector and matrix operations.
They are widely used as the basis for other high quality linear
algebra software, for example lapack and linpack.  This
implementation is the Fortran 77 reference implementation found
at netlib.

This package contains a set of programs which test the integrity
of an installed blas-compatible shared library.  These programs
may therefore be used to test the libraries provided by the
blas package as well as those provided by the atlas packages.
The programs are dynamically linked -- one can explicitly select
a library to test by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD
environment variables.  Likewise, one can display the library
selected using the ldd program in an identical environment.
