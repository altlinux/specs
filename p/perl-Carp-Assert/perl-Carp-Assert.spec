%description
Carp::Assert is intended for a purpose like the ANSI C library
assert.h.  If you're already familiar with assert.h, then you can
probably skip this and go straight to the FUNCTIONS section.

Assertions are the explict expressions of your assumptions about the
reality your program is expected to deal with, and a declaration of
those which it is not.  They are used to prevent your program from
blissfully processing garbage inputs (garbage in, garbage out becomes
garbage in, error out) and to tell you when you've produced garbage
output.  (If I was going to be a cynic about Perl and the user nature,
I'd say there are no user inputs but garbage, and Perl produces
nothing but...)
