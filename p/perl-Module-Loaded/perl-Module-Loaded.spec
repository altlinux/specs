%description
When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided
by external modules. Rather than munging the %%INC by hand to mark
these external modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded
by perl, this module offers you a very simple way to mark modules as
loaded and/or unloaded.
