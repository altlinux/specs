%description
This Perl module provides routines for checking validity of email address.

If is possible to turn off some or all networking checks (items 2 and 3).
See "GLOBAL VARIABLES".

This module was designed with CGIs (or any other dynamic Web content
programmed with Perl) in mind.  Usually it is required to quickly
check e-mail addresses in forms.  If the check can't be finished in
reasonable time, the e-mail address should be treated as valid.  This
is the default policy.  By default if a timeout happens the result of
the check is treated as positive.  This behavior can be overridden -
see "GLOBAL VARIABLES".
