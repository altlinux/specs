%description
This module is used to discover what RBL's are listing a particular IP
address.  It parallelizes requests for fast response.

An RBL, or Realtime Blackhole List, is a list of IP addresses meeting some
criteria such as involvement in Unsolicited Bulk Email.  Each RBL has
its own criteria for addition and removal of addresses.  If you want to
block email or other traffic to/from your network based on one or more
RBL's, you should carefully study the behavior of those RBL's before and
during such blocking.
