%description
A Data::ICal object represents a VCALENDAR object as defined in
the iCalendar protocol (RFC 2445, MIME type "text/calendar"), as
implemented in many popular calendaring programs such as Apple's iCal.
Each Data::ICal object is a collection of "entries", which are objects
of a subclass of Data::ICal::Entry. The types of entries defined
by iCalendar (which refers to them as "components") include events,
to-do items, journal entries, free/busy time indicators, and time zone
descriptors; in addition, events and to-do items can contain alarm
entries. (Currently, Data::ICal only implements to-do items and events.)
Data::ICal is a subclass of Data::ICal::Entry; see its manpage for more
methods applicable to Data::ICal.
