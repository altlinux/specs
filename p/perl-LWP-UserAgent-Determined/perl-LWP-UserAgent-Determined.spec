%description
This class works just like LWP::UserAgent (and is based on it, by
being a subclass of it), except that when you use it to get a web page
but run into a possibly-temporary error (like a DNS lookup timeout),
it'll wait a few seconds and retry a few times.

It also adds some methods for controlling exactly what errors are
considered retry-worthy and how many times to wait and for how many
seconds, but normally you needn't bother about these, as the default
settings are relatively sane.
