%description
IMAP::Admin provides basic IMAP server adminstration.  It provides
functions for creating and deleting mailboxes and setting various
information such as quotas and access rights.

It's interface should, in theory, work with any RFC compliant IMAP server,
but I currently have only tested it against Carnegie Mellon University's
Cyrus IMAP and Mirapoint's IMAP servers.  It does a CAPABILITY check
for specific extensions to see if they are supported.

Operationally it opens a socket connection to the IMAP server and logs
in with the supplied login and password.  You then can call any of the
functions to perform their associated operation.
