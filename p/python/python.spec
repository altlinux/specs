%description
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python includes
modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and
dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and
libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
Mac and MFC).

Programmers can write new built-in modules for Python in C or C++.
Python can be used as an extension language for applications that
need a programmable interface. This package contains most of the
standard Python modules, as well as modules for interfacing to the
Tix widget set for Tk and RPM.

Note that documentation for Python is provided in the python-docs
package.

%description tools-pynche
Pynche is a color editor based largely on a similar program that I
originally wrote back in 1987 for the Sunview window system.  That editor
was called ICE, the Interactive Color Editor.  I'd always wanted to port
this program to X but didn't feel like hacking X and C code to do it.  Fast
forward many years, to where Python + Tkinter provides such a nice
programming environment, with enough power, that I finally buckled down and
re-implemented it.  I changed the name because these days, too many other
systems have the acronym CE'.

* Mon Jul 02 2018 Ivan Zakharyaschev <imz@altlinux.org> 2.7.14-alt7
- Made distutils install maximum Python minus python-dev
  to mitigate the separation from python-dev (for building packages).

* Fri Jun 29 2018 Ivan Zakharyaschev <imz@altlinux.org> 2.7.14-alt6
- move distutils into a separate pkg from python-dev
  (because it can be used at runtime by other libs/executables).

* Fri Jun 29 2018 Michael Shigorin <mike@altlinux.org> 2.7.14-alt5
- E2K:
  + support e2kv4 through %%e2k macro (grenka@)
  + reworked -lcxa quirk towards lcc-1.23+ compatibility

* Thu May 31 2018 Aleksei Nikiforov <darktemplar@altlinux.org> 2.7.14-alt4
- Fixed heap-use-after-free bug (Fixes: CVE-2018-1000030).

* Wed May 30 2018 Andrey Bychkov <mrdrew@altlinux.org> 2.7.14-alt3.1

    because they are read too often (ALT#34660)
  + Fix escaping of backslash in buildreq's ignore.d regular expression
- Kept nis module despite the deprecation of NIS in glibc because it
  used to be a part of our standard "interface". Split nis from
  python-modules so that the rebuild of dependents will make them
  obtain an explicit dep on it. (python-modules will require it for a
  while not to break the past promise.)
- Fixed detection of linux distribution (thx mrdrew)
- (e2k arch) Link against -lcxa (thx mike@, sem@)
- (.spec) Renamed bootstrap knob to bluez, enabled by default (thx mike@)

* Wed Mar 23 2016 Ivan Zakharyaschev <imz@altlinux.org> 2.7.11-alt2
- /etc/buildreqs/files/ignore.d/python: fixed on x86_64 and added
