%description
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java. Python includes
modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types and
dynamic typing. Python supports interfaces to many system calls and
libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk,
Mac and MFC).

Programmers can write new built-in modules for Python in C or C++.
Python can be used as an extension language for applications that
need a programmable interface. This package contains most of the
standard Python modules, as well as modules for interfacing to the
Tix widget set for Tk and RPM.

Note that documentation for Python is provided in the python-docs
package.

%description tools-pynche
Pynche is a color editor based largely on a similar program that I
originally wrote back in 1987 for the Sunview window system.  That editor
was called ICE, the Interactive Color Editor.  I'd always wanted to port
this program to X but didn't feel like hacking X and C code to do it.  Fast
forward many years, to where Python + Tkinter provides such a nice
programming environment, with enough power, that I finally buckled down and
re-implemented it.  I changed the name because these days, too many other
systems have the acronym CE'.
