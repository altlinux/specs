%description
Net::Write provides a portable interface to open a network interface, and be able to write raw data directly to the network. It juste provides three methods when a Net::Write object has been created for an interface: open, send, close.

It is possible to open a network interface to send frames at layer 2 (you craft a frame from link layer), or at layer 3 (you craft a frame from network layer), or at layer 4 (you craft a frame from transport layer).

NOTE: not all operating systems support all layer opening. Currently, Windows only supports opening and sending at layer 2. Other Unix systems should be able to open and send at all layers.
