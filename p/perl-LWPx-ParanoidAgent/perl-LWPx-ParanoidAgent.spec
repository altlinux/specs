%description
The "LWPx::ParanoidAgent" is a class subclassing "LWP::UserAgent",
but paranoid against attackers.  It's to be used when you're fetching
a remote resource on behalf of a possibly malicious user.

This class can do whatever "LWP::UserAgent" can (callbacks, uploads from
files, etc), except proxy support is explicitly removed, because in
that case you should do your paranoia at your proxy.

Also, the schemes are limited to http and https, which are mapped to
"LWPx::Protocol::http_paranoid" and
"LWPx::Protocol::https_paranoid", respectively, which are forked
versions of the same ones without the "_paranoid".  Subclassing them
didn't look possible, as they were essentially just one huge function.

This class protects you from connecting to internal IP ranges (unless you
whitelist them), hostnames/IPs that you blacklist, remote webserver
tarpitting your process (the timeout parameter is changed to be a global
timeout over the entire process), and all combinations of redirects and
DNS tricks to otherwise tarpit and/or connect to internal resources.
