%description
This module is a subclass of "Locale::Maketext", with additional
support for localizing messages that already contains interpolated
variables.  This is most useful when the messages are returned by
external modules -- for example, to match "dir: command not found"
against "[_1]: command not found".

Of course, this module is also useful if you're simply too lazy
to use the

    $lh->maketext("[quant,_1,file,files] deleted.", $count);

syntax, but wish to write

    $lh->maketext_fuzzy("$count files deleted");

instead, and have the correct plural form figured out automatically.

If "maketext_fuzzy" seems too long to type for you, this module
also provides a "override_maketext" method to turn *all* "maketext"
calls into "maketext_fuzzy" calls.
