%description
the Net::INET6Glue manpage is a collection of modules to make common modules IPv6 ready
by hotpatching them.

Unfortunatly the current state of IPv6 support in perl is that no IPv6 support
is in the core and that a lot of important modules (like the Net::FTP manpage,
the Net::SMTP manpage, the LWP manpage,...) do not support IPv6 even if the modules for IPv6
sockets the Socket6 manpage, the IO::Socket::INET6 manpage are available.

This module tries to mitigate this by hotpatching.
Currently the following submodules are available:

=over 4

=item the Net::INET6Glue::INET_is_INET6 manpage

Makes the IO::Socket::INET manpage behave like the IO::Socket::INET6 manpage, especially make it
capable to create IPv6 sockets. This makes the LWP manpage, the Net::SMTP manpage and others
IPv6 capable.

=item the Net::INET6Glue::FTP manpage

Hotpatches the Net::FTP manpage to support EPRT and EPSV commands which are needed to
deal with FTP over IPv6. Also loads the Net::INET6Glue::INET_is_INET6 manpage.
