%description
Pod::Spell is a Pod formatter whose output is good for
spellchecking.  Pod::Spell rather like Pod::Text, except that
it doesn't put much effort into actual formatting, and it suppresses things
that look like Perl symbols or Perl jargon (so that your spellchecking
program won't complain about mystery words like "$thing"
or ""Foo::Bar"" or "hashref").

This class provides no new public methods.  All methods of interest are
inherited from Pod::Parser (which see).  The especially
interesting ones are "parse_from_filehandle" (which without arguments
takes from STDIN and sends to STDOUT) and "parse_from_file".  But you
can probably just make do with the examples in the synopsis though.

This class works by filtering out words that look like Perl or any
form of computerese (like "$thing" or ""N>7"" or
""@{$foo}{'bar','baz'}"", anything in C<...> or F<...>
codes, anything in verbatim paragraphs (codeblocks), and anything
in the stopword list.  The default stopword list for a document starts
out from the stopword list defined by Pod::Wordlist,
and can be supplemented (on a per-document basis) by having
"=for stopwords" / "=for :stopwords" region(s) in a document.
