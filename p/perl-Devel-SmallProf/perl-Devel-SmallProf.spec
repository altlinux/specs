%description
The Devel::SmallProf profiler is focused on the time taken for a program run on
a line-by-line basis.  It is intended to be as "small" in terms of impact on
the speed and memory usage of the profiled program as possible and also in
terms of being simple to use.  Those statistics are placed in the file
smallprof.out in the following format:

        <num> <time> <ctime> <line>:<text>

where <num> is the number of times that the line was executed, <time> is the
amount of "wall time" (time according the the clock on the wall vs. cpu time)
spent executing it, <ctime> is the amount of cpu time expended on it and <line>
and <text> are the line number and the actual text of the executed line (read
from the file).

The package uses the debugging hooks in Perl and thus needs the -d switch,
so to profile test.pl, use the command:

	perl5 -d:SmallProf test.pl

Once the script is done, the statistics in smallprof.out can be sorted to
show which lines took the most time.  The output can be sorted to find which
lines take the longest, either with the sort command:

	sort -k 2nr,2 smallprof.out | less

or a perl script:

	open(PROF,"smallprof.out");
	@sorted = sort {(split(/\s+/,$b))[2] <=>
                        (split(/\s+/,$a))[2]} <PROF>;
        close PROF;
	print join('',@sorted);
