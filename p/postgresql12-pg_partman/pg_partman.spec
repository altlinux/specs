%description
pg_partman is an extension to create and manage both time-based and serial-based
table partition sets. Native partitioning in PostgreSQL 10 is supported as of
pg_partman v3.0.1 and much more extensively as of 4.0.0 along with
PostgreSQL 11. Note that all the features of trigger-based partitioning
are not yet supported in native, but performance in both reads & writes is
significantly better.
