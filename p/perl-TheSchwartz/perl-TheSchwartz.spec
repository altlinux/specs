%description
TheSchwartz is a reliable job queue system.
Your application can put jobs into the system, and your worker processes 
can pull jobs from the queue atomically to perform. Failed jobs can be 
left in the queue to retry later.

Abilities specify what jobs a worker process can perform.
Abilities are the names of TheSchwartz::Worker subclasses, 
as in the synopsis: the MyWorker class name is used to specify 
that the worker script can perform the job. When using 
the TheSchwartz client's work functions, the class-ability duality 
is used to automatically dispatch to the proper class to do the actual work.
