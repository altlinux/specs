%description
Path::Class is a module for manipulation of file and directory
specifications (strings describing their locations, like
'/home/ken/foo.txt' or 'C:\Windows\Foo.txt') in a cross-platform
manner. It supports pretty much every platform Perl runs on,
including Unix, Windows, Mac, VMS, Epoc, Cygwin, OS/2, and
NetWare.

The well-known module File::Spec also provides this service, but
it's sort of awkward to use well, so people sometimes avoid it,
or use it in a way that won't actually work properly on
platforms significantly different than the ones they've tested
their code on.
