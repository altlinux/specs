%description
CSS::Tiny is a perl class to read and write .css stylesheets with as little
code as possible, reducing load time and memory overhead. CSS.pm requires about
2.6 meg or ram to load, which is a large amount of overhead if you only want to
do trivial things. Memory usage is normally scoffed at in Perl, but in my
opinion should be at least kept in mind.

This module is primarily for reading and writing simple files, and anything we
write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. If you need something with
more power, move up to CSS.pm. With the increasing complexity of CSS, this is
becoming more common, but many situations can still live with simple CSS files.
