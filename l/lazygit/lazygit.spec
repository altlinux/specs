%description
A simple terminal UI for git commands, written in Go with the gocui
library.

Rant time: You've heard it before, git is powerful, but what good is
that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing
requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? Are you
kidding me? To stage part of a file you need to use a command line
program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any
further but contains code you don't want to stage, you have to edit an
arcane patch file by hand? Are you KIDDING me?! Sometimes you get asked
to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that
after you switch and unstash that there weren't even any conflicts and
it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? YOU HAVE
GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!

If you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how
powerful git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your
ass, lazygit might be for you.
