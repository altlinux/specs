%description
libTorrent is designed to avoid redundant copying and storing of data
that other clients and libraries suffer from. libTorrent features:

* The client has full control over the polling of sockets.
* Sigc++ signals makes it easy for the client to react to events.
* Fast resume which checks the file modification time.
* Direct reading and writing from network to mmap'ed files.
* File hash check uses the same thread; client can control the rate;
  non-blocking and preload to memory with the mincore and madvise.
* File handler: fine-grained use of file read/write permissions, allows
  seeding of read-only files; allows torrents with unlimited number of
  files; opens closed files when mapping chunks to memory, with graceful
  error handling; support for files larger than 2 GB; different download
  priorities for files in the torrent.
* Multi-tracker support.
* No dependency on any specific HTTP library, the client implements a
  wrapper class.
* Dynamic request pipe size.
* Upload and download throttle.
* And much more...
