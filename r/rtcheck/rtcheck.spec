# Upstream research:
#   It seems, the program is supplied by IBM to RedHat directly
#   and then ends up in CentOS. And may be to SUSE too, in ibmrtpkgs-2
#   (IBM Utilities for SLERT) package. No upstream repo is found.

%description
The rtcheck program is an application that tests the running system for
real-time capabilities. If it identifies all capabilities, it will return an
exit code of 0. If some capabilities are not present, it will return with a
non-zero exit code. This program can be used by real-time-enabled programs
to determine if the environment they are in is suitable for them to run
correctly.
