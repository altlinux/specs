%description
Range library for C++14/17/20. This code was the basis
of a formal proposal to add range support to the C++ standard library.
That proposal evolved through a Technical Specification,
and finally into P0896R4 "The One Ranges Proposal"
which was merged into the C++20 working drafts in November 2018.
