%description
Introducing Intel One Mono, an expressive monospaced font family
that's built with clarity, legibility, and the needs of developers
in mind.

It's easier to read, and available for free, with an open-source
font license.

Identifying the typographically underserved low-vision developer
audience, Frere-Jones Type designed the Intel One Mono typeface in
partnership with the Intel Brand Team and VMLY&R, for maximum
legibility to address developers' fatigue and eyestrain and reduce
coding errors. A panel of low-vision and legally blind developers
provided feedback at each stage of design.

Intel One Mono also covers a wide range of over 200 languages using
the Latin script. The Intel One Mono fonts are provided in four
weights - Light, Regular, Medium, and Bold - with matching italics,
and we are happy to share both an official release of fonts ready
to use as well as editable sources.
