%description
Friture is an application to visualize and analyze live audio data
in real-time. Friture displays audio data in several widgets, such as
a scope, a spectrum analyzer, or a rolling 2D spectrogram.
This program can be useful to analyze and equalize the audio response
of a hall, or for educational purposes, etc.
The name *Friture* is a french word for *frying*, also used for *noise*
in a sound.
