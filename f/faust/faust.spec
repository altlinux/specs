%description
FAUST is a compiled language for real-time audio signal processing.

The name FAUST stands for Functional AUdio STream. Its programming model 
combines two approaches : functional programming and block diagram composition.
You can think of FAUST as a structured block diagram language with a textual syntax.

Programming with FAUST is somehow like working with electronic circuits
and signals. A FAUST program is a list of definitions that defines a signal
processor block-diagram : a piece of code that produces output signals
according to its input signals (and maybe some user interface parameters).

Faust is a compiled language translated to C++. In order to generate the most
efficient code, the compilation is based on a semantic approach. Instead of
compiling directly the block-diagram as described by the user, the idea is to
compile its mathematical meaning (what it actually computes).
