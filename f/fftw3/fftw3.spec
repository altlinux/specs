%description
FFTW is a free collection of fast C routines for computing the Discrete
Fourier Transform in one or more dimensions.  It includes complex, real,
symmetric, and parallel transforms, and can handle arbitrary array sizes
efficiently.  FFTW is typically faster than other publically-available
FFT implementations, and is even competitive with vendor-tuned libraries.
To achieve this performance, FFTW uses novel code-generation and runtime
self-optimization techniques (along with many other tricks).
