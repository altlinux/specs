%description
GraphicsMagick provides a powerful image manipulation and translation
utility. It is capable of displaying still images and animations using
the X Window system, provides a simple interface for interactively
editing images, and is capable of importing selected windows or the
entire desktop. GraphicsMagick can read and write over 88 image
formats, including JPEG, TIFF, WMF, SVG, PNG, PNM, GIF, and Photo CD.
It can resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special effects to
the image and save the result to any supported format. GraphicsMagick
may be used to create animated or transparent .gifs, create composite
images, create thumbnail images, and much, much, more.

- New version
- Fix ALT (#22348)
- Change number of bits in a pixel quantum 8 -> 16
- Fix build with libfpx
- Security Fixes:
  + Fix for CVE-2009-1882 "Integer overflow in the XMakeImage function".
  + Fix lockup due to hanging in loop while parsing malformed
    sub-image specification (SourceForge issue 2886560).
  + Libltdl: Updated libtool to 2.2.6b in order to fix security issue.
    Resolves CVE-2009-3736 as it pertains to GraphicsMagick.
- Bug fixes:
  + -convolve, -recolor: Validate that user-provided matrix is square
    when parsing -convolve and -recolor commands in order to avoid a
    core dump.
  + CALS: Reading images taller than the image width resulted in a
    failure.
  + ConstituteImage(), DispatchImage(): 'A' and 'T' should indicate
    transparency and 'O' should indicate opacity.  Behavior was
    inconsistent.  In some cases 'O' meant transparency while in other
    cases it meant opacity. Also, in a few cases, matte was not
    getting enabled in the image as it should.
  + DCRAW: Module name was not registered so modules based builds were
    not supporting formats provided via 'dcraw'.
  + GetOptimalKernelWidth1D(), GetOptimalKernelWidth2D(): In the Q32
    build, convolution kernel size was estimated incorrectly for large
    sigmas on 32-bit systems due to arithmetic overflow.  This could
    cause wrong results for -convolve, -blur, -sharpen, and other
    algorithms which use these functions.
  + Image Size: Fixed the ability to pass the image size via the
    filename specification like "myfile.jpg[640x480]" rather than
    needing to use -size.
  + IPTC: Blob data needed to be padded to an even size.  Size is now
    correctly reported.
  + IPTC: Returned IPTC string values were one character too short.
  + Large Files: Large pixel cache files were not working under GNU Linux.
  + JP2: Fixed some value scaling problems.
  + JP2: Fix possible crash at exit when Jasper is used by a modules build.
  + MPC: is_monochrome and is_grayscale flags were not managed
    properly for the MPC coder.
  + PCL: Page was not always being ejected.
  + PNG: The png8 encoder would fail when trying to write a 1-color image.
  + PSD: PSD parser was confused by 0x0 pixel layers, resulting in
    image data corruption of all following layers.
  + -rotate, -shear: Some internally-reported errors were potentially
    being lost.
  + Subrange/stdin: Commands now support reading an image from stdin
    in conjunction with a subrange specification (e.g. "-[1]").
  + Magick++ STL ShadeImage: Implementation was completely botched.
- New Features:
  + CALS Type 1 files may now be written (Work contributed by John
    Sergeant).  CALS support is dependent on the TIFF library.
  + GROUP4RAW encoder supports reading/writing RAW Group4 data.
  + JP2: JPEG 2000 may now be written in arbitrary bit depths ranging
    from 2 to 16 rather than just 8 or 16.
  + JPEG: IJG JPEG library version 7 is now supported.
  + JPEG: Added jpeg:block-smoothing and jpeg:fancy-upsampling defines
    to control these JPEG library options.
  + JPEG: Detect and apply colorspaces appropriately for ITU FAX JPEG.
  + Resource Limits: There is now a "threads" resource limit which
    allows specifying the number of OpenMP threads which may be used,
    similar to the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable.
  + TIFF: Allow CIELAB TIFF to be read.
  + MagickGetImageAttribute()/MagickSetImageAttribute(): New Wand
    methods to support getting and setting an image attribute.
    Contributed by Mikko Koppanen.
  + ClonePixelWand(): New Wand method to deep-copy an existing pixel wand.
  + ClonePixelWands(): New Wand method to deep-copy an array of
    existing pixel wands.
  + MagickCdlImage(): New Wand method to apply the ASC CDL to an
    image.
  + MagickGetImageBoundingBox(): New Wand method to return the crop
    bounding box required to remove any solid-color border from the
    image.
  + MagickGetImageFuzz(), MagickSetImageFuzz(): New Wand methods to
    get and set the color comparison fuzz factor.
  + MagickHaldClutImage(): New Wand method to apply a Hald CLUT to an
    image.
  + MagickSetResolution(): New Wand method to set the wand resolution.
  + MagickSetResolutionUnits(): New Wand method to set the wand
    resolution units.

* Fri Sep 18 2009 Slava Dubrovskiy <dubrsl@altlinux.org> 1.3.7-alt1
- New version
- Security Fixes:
  + PCX: Detect improper rows, columns, or depth.  Fixes CVE-2008-1097
    "Memory corruption in ImageMagick's PCX coder".
  + DrawDashPolygon: Avoid a crash which sometimes occured with tiny
    polygons.
- Bug fixes:
  + JPEG: Profile chunks need to be concatentated in order to build
    the whole profile.  This was not working so embedded profiles
    larger than 32K or maybe 64K were being corrupted.  This bug was
    introduced in GraphicsMagick 1.2.
  + Meta: Fix memory leaks.
  + Meta: Work better with with IPTC record 2 blocks and deal better
    with IPTC embedded in an 8BIM profile.  Fixes by John Sergeant.
  + MPC: Fix crash when reading MPC and the input image is modified.
  + PNG: Ensure that the opacity channel is properly initialized.
  + -profile: Lowercase arguments were sometimes not working as
    expected.
  + Topol: Topol reader actually works now and is included in test suite.
  + TIFF: Read and write JPEG-compressed grayscale TIFF correctly.
  + VisualMagick configure now works properly when output paths are
     specified.
  + WMF: Eliminate memory leaks.
- New Features:
  + MagickWand: New method MagickSetCompressionQuality() to allow
    setting the compression quality.
  + MagickWand: New method CloneDrawingWand() to deep-copy a drawing wand.
  + MagickWand: New method DrawGetException() to retrieve information
    regarding the last drawing wand exception (if any).
  + MagickWand: New method DrawClearException() to clear a drawing wand
    exception.
  + Magick++: New Image method cdl() to apply the ASC CDL.
  + Magick++: New Image method colorMatrix() to apply a color matrix
    to the image channels.
  + Magick++: New Image method haldClut() to apply a color lookup
    table (Hald CLUT) to the image.
  + MSL/Conjure: Added a new 'profile' command which applies, adds, or
    removes one or more IPTC, ICC or generic profiles from a file.
    Work contributed by John Sergeant.
  + Added a 'time' subcommand to provide Unix-style 'time' output when
    a 'time' capability is missing, or the reporting format is
    inconsistent.  For example 'gm time convert ...'.
- Feature improvements:
  + ColorMatrixImage(): Add opaque opacity channel when needed.
  + PDF & PS: Use '-type palette' prior to input file name to cause
    Ghostscript to return a dithered colormapped image.
  + PNG: Now compiles with libpng-1.4.0beta74 and later.
  + TIFF: Libtiff in Windows build is upgraded to 3.9.1.  This allows
    GraphicsMagick to read and write 16 and 24 bit float TIFF files.
  + Windows code to find Ghostscript is rewritten from scratch.
- Performance Improvements:
  + Drawing of points, lines, and polygons (and complex shapes based
    on these) is now accelerated using OpenMP with excellent speed-up.
  + ICC color transforms now see linear speedup from OpenMP.
  + Rotate: For rotations of 90 or 270 degrees, tile sizes are
    selected more appropriately.
- Behavior Changes:
  + No longer clear the exception structure at the start of
    ReadImage() and other similar functions since this sometimes masks
    errors.  The API user is expected to make sure that the exception
    structure is clean prior to invoking a function.
  + SVG: Writer is now disabled since it usually does not work properly.

  + GraphicsMagick++-config no longer depends on GraphicsMagick-config to
    be in the executable search path.
- Performance improvments:
  + Exploratory support for OpenMP in the image resize code.  Can result
    in significant performance improvement when significantly reducing
    the image size on multi-core systems, but little to no improvement
    when the input and output images are close to the same size.
  + Module loading and execution performance are improved considerably
    for the modules build. On some systems, the modules build is
    considerably faster than the static or shared builds.
- Feature improvements:
  + Composition now supports CopyCyan, CopyMagenta, CopyYellow, and
    CopyBlack in order to copy CMYK channels into an image. CMYK copy
    composition operators automatically set the image colorspace to CMYK
    so that everything just works.

    returns a success error code to GraphicsMagick. Verify that
    Ghostscript has updated the output file before attempting to use it.
  + Fixed a configure script syntax error when testing for trio.
  + When requesting a list of formats, all of the modules in the module
    search path are considered. Previously only the modules in the same
    directory as the LOGO module were listed.
  + Ensure that an image clip mask is respected by the negate algorithm.
  + The BMP writer was sometimes writing incorrect BMP v4 files.
  + Support reading and writing large PCX files.
  + Fixed a bug which could cause possible truncation while cloning the
    image cache.
  + Ensure that MIFF files indicate the compression which was actually used.
  + Properly handle errors from libtiff so that corrupted images are not
    output.
  + Fix for stripped-TIFF reader. Discard extra samples beyond alpha in
    scanline TIFFs.

  + Fix for SourceForge bug id 1625477 "Memory leak reading layered PSD Image".
  + Fix for SourceForge bug id 1878992 "literal square brackets in file
    name cause large delay and bug id 1783209 "converting runs slowly
    when subimage is specified".
  + Fix for SourceForge bug id 1883527 "compression of tiff-file has no effect".
  + Successfully read files in the form "file[123]".
  + Fix reading 12-bit grayscale JPEG.
  + Set image depth appropriately when importing image from X11 display.
  + Fix map resource tracking.
  + Fix reading recent variants of ImageMagick's MIFF format.
  + Output bilevel TIFF meeting the TIFF Class F specification.
- New Utilities:
  + A 'benchmark' subcommand is now available to benchmark the
    performance of any other arbitrary subcommand (e.g. 'convert').
- Feature improvements:
  + LZW compression is now enabled by default.
  + Support industry-standard subsampling notation like "4:2:2".
  + If gm is executed under a traditional alternate name (e.g.
    convert), it will invoke the appropriate sub-command. This allows
    use of hard links, symbolic links, or just copying 'gm' to the
    desired sub-command name in order to achieve 100%% ImageMagick 5.5.2
    utility compatibility.
  + Provide the --enable-magick-compat option when configuring to install
    ImageMagick utilities compatibility links.
  + Identify -verbose output includes normalized (0.0-1.0) statistics.
  + Identify and convert now print "pixels per second" rates to help
    evaluate performance.
  + Added the identify +ping option to force reading the complete file.
  + The display program now supports the +progress option to disable any
    visual progress indication (and hourglass cursor) while loading images.
  + Support writing grayscale TGA files.
  + Provide explicit support for Rec 601 and Rec 709 grayscale spaces.
  + Include some support for a log RGB space based on the 2.048 density
    range as defined for the Cineon Digital Film System.
  + Added utilities command-line support for industry standard subsampling
    notation like 4:4:4 and 4:2:2.
  + Use MAGICK_IOBUF_SIZE to tune the size of the I/O buffer.
  + Use -type Bilevel, Grayscale, TrueColor, or TrueColorMatte to
    influence the type of image that Ghostscript returns.
  + Use '-define tiff:fill-order={msb2lsb|lsb2msb}' to control TIFF bit
    fill order.
  + The -version option now dumps a feature list as well as the build
    options.
  + The -endian option now supports the option 'native'.
  + A -monitor is added to enable progress monitoring for the command line
    utilities.
  + Use the -output-directory option to 'mogrify' to send output files to
    the specified directory.
  + Use the -create-directories option in conjunction with
    -output-directory and 'mogrify' to create any necessary subdirectories.
  + A Pixels resource limit is added.  Use '-limit Pixels value' to limit
    the maximum number of pixels in an image to 'value'.
  + The already supported option '-type Optimize' is now honored by
    formats that need to choose a subformat based on the properties of
    the image. Grueling tests of many/all pixels are not performed
    unless '-type Optimize' is supplied.
  + Added a a -set option to the composite, convert, display, mogrify,
    import commands in order to allow setting an image attribute.
  + Display utility no longer defaults to reading from standard input if
    stdin is not a tty.
  + May now be configured to use the umem memory allocation library
    available in Solaris 9, Update 3 and later, or from the portable umem
    project.
- Coder additions/improvements:
  + Replaced existing DPX "support" with all-new DPX support conforming
    to the SMPTE 268M-2003 standard.
  + Cineon reader completely rewritten.
  + TIFF coder is completely re-written. Now supports reading and
    writing RGB, CMYK, and grayscale, scanline-oriented TIFF images
    with arbitrary (1 to 32 bits) depth. Includes support for tiled
    TIFF, floating point TIFF, LogLuv TIFF, BigTIFF, arbitrary depths,
    and associated alpha.
  + TIFF coder now supports retrieving and saving XMP profiles.
  + MATLAB support is much improved and supports writing as well.
  + WPG reader now supports CTM translations.
  + ART format now supports writing.
  + Support 32-bit raw RGB images.
  + Support 32-bit raw CMYK images.
  + Support 32-bit raw gray images.
  + JP2 coder reads images in YCbCr colorspace and retrieves an embedded
    ICC ICM color profile if present.
- Performance improvments:
  + The DispatchImage() and ConstituteImage() functions incorporate
    special case code for BGR, BGRO, BGRP, RGB, RGBO, and I formats (8
    bit only) in order to improve performance dramatically.
  + When writing very large JPEG images, don't enable Huffman compression
    since doing so requires libjpeg to buffer the entire image in memory.
  + When using the 'identify' -verbose option, -verbose must be specified
    twice in order to obtain the color count.  This makes normal use of
    -verbose much faster.
  + Significantly improved read/write speed for bilevel and gray images.
  + TIFF I/O is considerably faster.
  + Postscript writer is 10-15X faster.
  + PNM formats writer is 10-100X faster.
  + Rotate by 90 or 270 degrees is 2-9X faster.
