- Ability to display Unix time of a task while using a custom output format;
- Ability to select tasks using a range of task IDs (the commit time of a task
  specified by the "after_task" and "before_task" parameters are used the same
  as values of the "after" and "before" parameters respectively).

* Wed Mar 20 2024 Alexey Appolonov <alexey@altlinux.org> 0.9.1-alt1
- Updated help notes.

* Fri Nov 17 2023 Alexey Appolonov <alexey@altlinux.org> 0.9.0-alt2
- Corrected copyright notices.

* Mon Nov 06 2023 Alexey Appolonov <alexey@altlinux.org> 0.9.0-alt1
- Ability to filter the results by src package names taken from a txt file;
- Ability to process all targets at once (with a single command).

* Sat Nov 04 2023 Alexey Appolonov <alexey@altlinux.org> 0.8.0-alt1
- Ability to filter resuls not only by a src package name, but also by its
  version and release;
- Branch names are displayed in the results.

* Wed Nov 01 2023 Alexey Appolonov <alexey@altlinux.org> 0.7.0-alt1
- The missing initial package versions are taken from the "plan/rm-src" files
  of the tasks.

* Fri Oct 27 2023 Alexey Appolonov <alexey@altlinux.org> 0.6.0-alt1
- A dump file is not used if the file "~/.alt-tasks/src_list" was modified after
  this dump file was created (rescan is performed).

* Sat Oct 14 2023 Alexey Appolonov <alexey@altlinux.org> 0.5.0-alt1
- Time saving on the processing the timelines of packages if a time of the
  previous processing is no latter than a requested "before" time (the dump
  file is used even if it's expired);
- The "after" param is checked to ensure that it doesn't exceed the current time
  (instead of getting an empty result, the program terminates with an error).

* Thu Oct 11 2023 Alexey Appolonov <alexey@altlinux.org> 0.4.0-alt1
- A previous version of a package is displayed for each subtask (use a new flag
  "--no_prev_ver" for the former behavior) as well as the "built from" part of
  a subtask commit designation ("gear" or "srpm").

* Mon Mar 01 2021 Alexey Appolonov <alexey@altlinux.org> 0.3.0-alt2
