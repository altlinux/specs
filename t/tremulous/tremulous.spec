%description
Tremulous is a free, open source game that blends a team based FPS with elements
of an RTS. Players can choose from 2 unique races, aliens and humans. Players on
both teams are able to build working structures in-game like an RTS. These
structures provide many functions, the most important being spawning. The
designated builders must ensure there are spawn structures or other players will
not be able to rejoin the game after death. Other structures provide automated
base defense (to some degree), healing functions and much more...

Player advancement is different depending on which team you are on. As a human,
players are rewarded with credits for each alien kill. These credits may be used
to purchase new weapons and upgrades from the "Armoury". The alien team advances
quite differently. Upon killing a human foe, the alien is able to evolve into a
new class. The more kills gained the more powerful the classes available.

The overall objective behind Tremulous is to eliminate the opposing team. This
is achieved by not only killing the opposing players but also removing their
ability to respawn by destroying their spawn structures.

This is a virtual package to install tremulous client and dedicated server.
