%description
Kirigami is a set of QtQuick components at the moment targeted for mobile use
(in the future desktop as well) targeting both Plasma Mobile and Android. It's
not a whole set of components, all the "Primitive" ones like buttons and
textboxes are a job for QtQuickControls (soon QtQuickControls2) but it's a set
of high level components to make the creation of applications that look and feel
great on mobile as well as desktop devices and follow the
https://community.kde.org/KDE_Visual_Design_Group/KirigamiHIG . The target of
those components is anybody that wants to do an application using QtQuick as its
main UI, especially if targeting a mobile platform, without adding many
dependencies. They work on a variety of platforms, such as Plasma Mobile,
Desktop Linux, Android and Windows. It will eventually become a Tier-1 KDE
Framework.
