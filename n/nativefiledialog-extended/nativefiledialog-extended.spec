%description
A small C library with that portably invokes native file open, folder
select and file save dialogs. Write dialog code once and have it pop up
native dialogs on all supported platforms. Avoid linking large
dependencies like wxWidgets and Qt.

This library is based on Michael Labbe's Native File Dialog (
mlabbe/nativefiledialog).
