- also save state when we exit due to SIGHUP
- don't get tripped up when enrollment helpers hand us certificates which
  include CRLF line terminators (ticket #25)
- be tolerant of certificate issuer names, subject names, DNS, email, and
  Kerberos principal namem subjectAltNames, and crl distribution point URLs
  that contain newlines
- read and cache the certificate template extension in certificates
- enforce different minimum key sizes depending on the type of key we're
  trying to generate
- store DER versions of subject, issuer and template subject, if we have
  them (Jan Cholasta, ticket #26)
- when generating signing requests with subject names that don't quite parse
  as subject names, encode what we're given as PrintableString rather than
  as a UTF8String
- always chdir() to a known location at startup, even if we're not becoming
  a daemon
- fix a couple of memory leaks (static analysis)
- add missing buildrequires: on which

* Thu Feb 20 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.73-1
- updates to 0.73
  - getcert no longer claims to be stuck when a CA is unreachable,
    because the daemon isn't actually stuck

* Mon Feb 17 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
- updates to 0.73
  - also pass the key type to enrollment helpers in the environment as
    a the value of "CERTMONGER_KEY_TYPE"

* Mon Feb 10 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
- move the tmpfiles.d file from /etc/tmpfiles.d to %%{_tmpfilesdir},
  where it belongs

* Mon Feb 10 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
- updates for 0.73
  - set the flag to encode EC public key parameters using named curves
    instead of the default of all-the-details when using OpenSSL
  - don't break when NSS supports secp521r1 but OpenSSL doesn't
  - also pass the CA nickname to enrollment helpers in the environment as
    a text value in "CERTMONGER_CA_NICKNAME", so they can use that value
    when reading configuration settings
  - also pass the SPKAC value to enrollment helpers in the environment as
    a base64 value in "CERTMONGER_SPKAC"
  - also pass the request's SubjectPublicKeyInfo value to enrollment helpers
    in the environment as a base64 value in "CERTMONGER_SPKI"
  - when generating signing requests using NSS, be more accommodating of
    requested subject names that don't parse properly

* Mon Feb  3 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.72-1
- update to 0.72
  - support generating DSA parameters and keys on sufficiently-new OpenSSL
    and NSS
  - support generating EC keys when OpenSSL and NSS support it, using key
    size to select the curve to use from among secp256r1, secp384r1,
    secp521r1 (which are the ones that are usually available, though
    secp521r1 isn't always, even if the other two are)
  - stop trying to cache public key parameters at all and instead cache public
    key info properly
  - encode the friendlyName attribute in signing requests as a BMPString,
    not as a PrintableString
  - catch more filesystem permissions problems earlier (more of #996581)

* Mon Jan 27 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.71-1
- check for cases where we fail to allocate memory while reading a request
  or CA entry from disk (John Haxby)
- only handle one watch at a time, which should avoid abort() during
  attempts to reconnect to the message bus after losing our connection
  to it (#1055521)

* Fri Jan 24 2014 Daniel Mach <dmach@redhat.com> - 0.70-2
- Mass rebuild 2014-01-24

* Thu Jan  2 2014 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.70-1
- add a --with-homedir option to configure, and use it, since subprocesses
  which we run and which use NSS may attempt to write to $HOME/.pki, and
  0.69's strategy of setting that to "/" was rightly hitting SELinux policy
  denials (#1047798)

* Fri Dec 27 2013 Daniel Mach <dmach@redhat.com> - 0.69-2
- Mass rebuild 2013-12-27

* Mon Dec  9 2013 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.69-1
- tweak how we decide whether we're on the master or a minion when we're
  told to use certmaster as a CA
- clean up one of the tests so that it doesn't have to work around internal
  logging producing duplicate messages
- when logging errors while setting up to contact xmlrpc servers, explicitly
  note that the error is client-side
- don't abort() due to incorrect locking when an attempt to save an issued
  certificate to the designated location fails (part of #1032760/#1033333,
  ticket #22)
- when reading an issued certificate from an enrollment helper, ignore
  noise before or after the certificate itself (more of #1032760/1033333,
  ticket #22)
- run subprocesses in a cleaned-up environment (more of #1032760/1033333,
  ticket #22)
- clear the ca-error that we saved when we had an error talking to the CA if we
  subsequently succeed in talking to the CA
- various other static-analysis fixes

- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_20_Mass_Rebuild

* Mon Mar 11 2013 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com> 0.67-1
- when saving certificates to NSS databases, try to preserve the trust
  value assigned to a previously-present certificate with the same nickname
  and subject, if one is found
- when saving certificates to NSS databases, also prune certificates from
  the database which have both the same nickname and subject as the one
  we're adding, to avoid tripping up tools that only fetch one certificate
  by nickname

* Fri Jun 15 2012 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>
- add a command option (-T) to getcert for specifying which enrollment
