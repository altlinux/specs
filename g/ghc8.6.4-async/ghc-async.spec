%description
Run IO operations asynchronously and wait for their results description:
This package provides a higher-level interface over threads, in which an
@Async a@ is a concurrent thread that will eventually deliver a value of
type @a@. The package provides ways to create @Async@ computations, wait
for their results, and cancel them.

Using @Async@ is safer than using threads in two ways:

* When waiting for a thread to return a result, if the thread dies with an
exception then the caller must either re-throw the exception ('wait') or
handle it ('waitCatch'); the exception cannot be ignored.

* The API makes it possible to build a tree of threads that are
automatically killed when their parent dies (see 'withAsync'). license:
