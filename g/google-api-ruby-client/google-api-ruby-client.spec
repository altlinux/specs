%description
This repository contains a set of simple client libraries for various Google
APIs. These libraries are generated automatically from Discovery Documents, and
the code generator is also hosted here in this repository.

Each client provides:

* A client object that connects to the HTTP/JSON REST endpoint for the
service.
* Ruby objects for data structures related to the service.
* Integration with the googleauth gem for authentication using OAuth, API keys,
and service accounts.
* Control of retry, pagination, and timeouts.

These client libraries are officially supported by Google, and are updated
regularly to track changes to the service. However, many Google services,
especially Google Cloud Platform services such as Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, and
BigQuery, may provide a more modern client that is easier to use and more
performant. See the section below titled "Which client should I use?" for more
information.

Simple REST client for BigQuery Reservation API V1 development package.

This is the simple REST client for BigQuery Reservation API V1. Simple REST
clients are Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google services via
their HTTP REST API endpoints. These libraries are generated and updated
automatically based on the discovery documents published by the service, and
they handle most concerns such as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts,
and logging. You can use this client to access the BigQuery Reservation API, but
note that some services may provide a separate modern client that is easier to
use.

Simple REST client for Books API V1 development package.

This is the simple REST client for Books API V1. Simple REST clients are Ruby
client libraries that provide access to Google services via their HTTP REST API
endpoints. These libraries are generated and updated automatically based on the
discovery documents published by the service, and they handle most concerns such
as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts, and logging. You can use this
client to access the Books API, but note that some services may provide a
separate modern client that is easier to use.

clients are Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google services via
their HTTP REST API endpoints. These libraries are generated and updated
automatically based on the discovery documents published by the service, and
they handle most concerns such as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts,
and logging. You can use this client to access the Dataproc Metastore API, but
note that some services may provide a separate modern client that is easier to
use.

Simple REST client for My Business Lodging API V1 development package.

This is the simple REST client for My Business Lodging API V1. Simple REST
clients are Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google services via
their HTTP REST API endpoints. These libraries are generated and updated
automatically based on the discovery documents published by the service, and
they handle most concerns such as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts,
and logging. You can use this client to access the My Business Lodging API, but
note that some services may provide a separate modern client that is easier to
use.

Simple REST client for Policy Troubleshooter API V1beta documentation
files.

This is the simple REST client for Policy Troubleshooter API V1beta. Simple REST
clients are Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google services via
their HTTP REST API endpoints. These libraries are generated and updated
automatically based on the discovery documents published by the service, and
they handle most concerns such as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts,
and logging. You can use this client to access the Policy Troubleshooter API,
but note that some services may provide a separate modern client that is easier
to use.

Simple REST client for Google Search Console API V1 documentation files.

This is the simple REST client for Google Search Console API V1. Simple REST
clients are Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google services via
their HTTP REST API endpoints. These libraries are generated and updated
automatically based on the discovery documents published by the service, and
they handle most concerns such as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts,
and logging. You can use this client to access the Google Search Console API,
but note that some services may provide a separate modern client that is easier
to use.

Simple REST client for Storage Transfer API V1 documentation files.

This is the simple REST client for Storage Transfer API V1. Simple REST clients
are Ruby client libraries that provide access to Google services via their HTTP
REST API endpoints. These libraries are generated and updated automatically
based on the discovery documents published by the service, and they handle most
concerns such as authentication, pagination, retry, timeouts, and logging. You
can use this client to access the Storage Transfer API, but note that some
services may provide a separate modern client that is easier to use.
